# KDE Configuration

Not my full KDE setup, but enough of it from the tools that I use and the
configuration I'm willing to share. I use i3 as my windowm manager but Konsole
and the Akonadi suite are the two apps in KDE I use the most.

## TODO

  + [ ] Instructions on installing.
  + [ ] Add some specific wallpapers I use on KDE.
  + [ ] Add credit where due.
